# Quick Calc
A calculator made in Python.

The main library that is being used is Tkinter for the GUI.

The calculator has a your regular number layout as you would on your keyboard number-pad.

It has simple calculation functions including: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

It is also capable of computing trigonometric functions.

We have also implemented buttons to convert regular numbers into binary numbers or hex numbers.

We added a neat history feature that will paste all the calculations done into a separate window.
You will be able to save your history into a file if so desired.

We have a simple bash script that will start up the calculator as well as perform some tests to see
if the calculator is running correctly.

TO RUN FILE: 
```
sh calc.sh
```

    Activity Diagram Alpha 1
    This diagram shows how we originally planned our program to work. It was created for the Alpha 1 version of our 
    calculator.

    Acitvity Diagram Release
    This diagram represents the final version of how our program is meant to work and is more organized than the 
    alpha version. There are some additional functions that the original does not have, but they follow similar 
    paths. The flow at end was updated to allow more efficient options for the user after finishing a calculation.

    This is the original diagram we made with functions that we could implement into Quick Calc.

    This is the final Class diagram showing the functions we were able to implement into Quick Calc.
